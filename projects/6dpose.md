In this project I developed a factor graph based algorithm for fusing sensor measurements in order to get a high accuracy pole tip position. 
In other words, I developed a sensor fusion algorithm to return high accuracy lag invariant measurements

### Project Requirements
The project was built using the GTSAM library. A library built upon factor graphs as the underlying computing paradigm and takes advantages of sparse matrices to optimize for larger computational requirements.
