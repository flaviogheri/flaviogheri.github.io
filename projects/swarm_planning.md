A fun side project implementing swarm path planning. Initially in the form of robot configurations for better stability. 

I will also look at possibility of using multi-agent sensor fusion for better localization of the swarm.

## Introducing a Swarm

The swarm is a collection of robots that can be used to perform tasks in a distributed manner. The robots can communicate with each other and share information about their environment. The goal of the swarm is to work together to achieve a common objective.

I personally believe this is a very strong area of research for planetary exploration as well as military applications. For this reason, by taking baby steps I hope to get the learning steps in order to implement a project I have had in the past.
