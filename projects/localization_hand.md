title: "Localization of SO100 Robot Hand"

In this project, after having developed the SO100 robot arm. I noticed how redunant it was to create an entire robot arm just to teach another. Therefore I decided to simplify it by creating a localization tool with just a single motor and localization tools. 

This will enable both external guidance systems (teleoperation) as well as even cheaper robot development. 

The project is still in its early stages, but I have already developed a basic localization system using a camera and imu. An article on this project will be released in due process as it is finalized.
